# Ultrawide Helper

A small tool to help with gaming on ultrawide and especially super ultrawide monitors. Can be used to automatically remove borders from games (or other applications) and position them on screen as desired. Hotkeys can be defined as well that move windows at the press of a button. UltrawideHelper can also hide the taskbar completely while the start menu is not visible on screen.
